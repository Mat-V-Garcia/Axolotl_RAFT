{"instruction": "Based on the provided document, what did the Council of Nicaea establish regarding Christ's nature?", "context": "The First Council of Nicaea was convened by Emperor Constantine I in 325 AD to address the Arian controversy. Arius, a priest from Alexandria, taught that the Son of God was a created being, subordinate to the Father. The council rejected Arianism and formulated the Nicene Creed, which declared that Christ is 'of one substance (homoousios) with the Father,' affirming his full divinity and eternal existence.

{"instruction": "What does the document say about the different views on sacraments between Catholic and Protestant traditions?", "context": "Christian traditions differ significantly in their understanding of sacraments. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches recognize seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony. These are considered channels of grace necessary for salvation. Protestant reformers, following the principle of sola scriptura, reduced the number to two: Baptism and the Lord's Supper, recognizing only those explicitly instituted by Christ in Scripture. Some Protestant groups prefer the term 'ordinances' to emphasize obedience rather than sacramental efficacy.", "cot_answer": "Let me examine what the document states about sacramental differences.\n\nFirst, regarding Catholic and Orthodox traditions:\n- They recognize seven sacraments\n- The seven are: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony\n- These are 'considered channels of grace necessary for salvation'\n\nRegarding Protestant traditions:\n- They reduced the number to two sacraments\n- The two are: Baptism and the Lord's Supper\n- The reason given is 'following the principle of sola scriptura'\n- They recognize 'only those explicitly instituted by Christ in Scripture'\n- Some groups prefer 'ordinances' over 'sacraments'\n\n<ANSWER>: According to the document, Catholic and Orthodox churches recognize seven sacraments as channels of grace necessary for salvation, while Protestant traditions recognize only two (Baptism and Lord's Supper) based on sola scriptura, recognizing only those explicitly instituted by Christ in Scripture."}
{"instruction": "According to the text, what are the different types of grace in Christian theology?", "context": "Grace is a central concept in Christian theology, referring to God's unmerited favor toward humanity. Theologians distinguish several types of grace. Prevenient grace, emphasized in Wesleyan theology, is God's grace that precedes human decision and draws people toward faith. Saving grace, or justifying grace, is the means by which God saves sinners through faith in Christ apart from works (Ephesians 2:8-9). Sanctifying grace refers to God's ongoing work in believers, transforming them into the likeness of Christ. Common grace describes God's general gifts to all humanity, such as sunshine, rain, and moral conscience, given regardless of faith.", "cot_answer": "Let me identify the types of grace mentioned in the document.\n\nThe document explicitly lists four types of grace:\n\n1. **Prevenient grace**:\n   - 'Emphasized in Wesleyan theology'\n   - 'God's grace that precedes human decision'\n   - 'Draws people toward faith'\n\n2. **Saving grace** (also called justifying grace):\n   - 'The means by which God saves sinners'\n   - 'Through faith in Christ apart from works'\n   - References Ephesians 2:8-9\n\n3. **Sanctifying grace**:\n   - 'God's ongoing work in believers'\n   - 'Transforming them into the likeness of Christ'\n\n4. **Common grace**:\n   - 'God's general gifts to all humanity'\n   - Examples: 'sunshine, rain, and moral conscience'\n   - 'Given regardless of faith'\n\n<ANSWER>: The document describes four types of grace: (1) Prevenient grace - God's grace preceding human decision, (2) Saving/justifying grace - the means of salvation through faith, (3) Sanctifying grace - God's ongoing transforming work in believers, and (4) Common grace - God's general gifts to all humanity regardless of faith."}
